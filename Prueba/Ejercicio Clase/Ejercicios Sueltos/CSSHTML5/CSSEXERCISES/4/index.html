<p class="FOX">Fox is a common name for many species <br> of carnivorous mammals belonging to the <br> Canidae family.</p> <p></p> Foxes are small to <br> medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than the <br> median-sized domestic dog), <br> characterized by possessing a long narrow <br> snout, and a bushy tail (or brush).
</p>

<p>
Members of about 37 species are referred <br> to as foxes, of which only 12 species <br> actually belong to the Vulpes <br> genus of 'true foxes'. By far the most common <br> and widespread species of fox <br> is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), <br> although various species are found on almost <br> every continent. The presence of fox-like <br> carnivores all over the globe has led <br> to their appearance in both popular <br> culture and folklore in many cultures <br> around the world <br> (see also Foxes in culture). The gray fox <br> is one of only two canine species known <br> to climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.
